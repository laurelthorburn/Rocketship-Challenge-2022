# Spacestagram: Image-sharing from the final frontier ðŸš€

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description

The purpose of this project was to share photos from one of NASA's APIs and to help Shopify extend their mission to everyone in the universe.   This site was created using handlebars, bootstrap, font awesome, javascript, html, and css.  The user is able to like/unlike their favorite photos, render new images, and expand content in order to learn more about the images of their choosing.  When a user clicks the image or video, the media opens in a new tab.
